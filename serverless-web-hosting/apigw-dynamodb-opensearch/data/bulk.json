{"title":"Which country in the world suffers most from wage inequality and why?","body":"Shall we discuss this topic in the comments? I'm curious to hear your opinions. I have written my own thoughts below.\r  \n\r  \nMany sources and studies highlight countries like Brazil, South Africa, India, and the United States as standing out in terms of income inequality. Inequality factors in these countries can include high income inequality, challenging working conditions faced by low-wage workers, racial or ethnic discrimination, gender inequality, and social class disparities.\r  \n\r  \nThe causes of income inequality in these countries can be complex and multifaceted. For example, high income inequality can sometimes reflect a wide economic gap between the rich and the poor. Challenging working conditions experienced by low-wage workers can arise from factors such as low job security, low wages, and limited social safety nets. One of the major causes, of course, is poor governance.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/14eeld2/which_country_in_the_world_suffers_most_from_wage/","comment":"Close your eyes, and you can choose one of the Arab countries that own oil. It will be in the front row. Statistically, I don't have any data. However, I can list the facts that support this idea.\r  \n1- There is a feudal administration, and these princes, the emirs, own almost all of the country's resources. The rich side of the inequality is not only in those countries but also among the richest in the world.\r  \n2- The culture of submissiveness prevents paid employees from organizing. They're only at the mercy of employers for wage increases. The fatalistic social spirit is deprived of the energy to change its life.\r  \n3- Most of the far eastern workers who go to work in these countries are employed by having their passports confiscated. The law doesn't protect you.\r  \n4- There is no need to talk about gender wage inequality. Women have no chance to have a say in their future outside of the workplace. It doesn't matter if women are spouses or siblings or women who work at home. Women have no say at all."}

{"title":"Passion","body":"Does your work drive you? Or is it something you separate yourself from?  \n\n\nMost people I know take pieces of themselves and apply them here or there. The aspect of myself that is motherhood is ready to turn on when work is over and my girls are back with me. I flip the switch to become a powerhouse when I sit at my computer, coffee in hand, ready to crank out what is needed.   \n\n\nBut what does it mean to actually live 100% as YOURSELF in this life. No switches needing to be flipped. The passion and focus that is normally fabricated, actually fueling you. Because there is all of a sudden a natural synchronicity between what you are spending most of your days doing to make money in order to support yourself and your family....and what you actually want to spend your time doing.   \n\n\nIf financial freedom opened up its doors for me today I would travel. Create the home environment that I've been dreaming of for years. Write a book. Spend time with my girls and my partner. Revel in the freedom of being able to wake up with the sun and do yoga on my rooftop, needing to rush for no one and nothing. But then, I would get to work.   \n\n\nI love business. I love the mechanics of providing a solution for an existing need. Figuring out the logistics. How incredible would it be to be able to play out your passion without fear of losing your home? Without worrying about how you are going to feed your family, or pay your bills?  \n\n\nMy passion is people. My personal mission in this life is to live out loud, love fervently, and leave a gentle ripple. I want to live my best, happiest, most peaceful life. And if I could spend my working hours doing anything, it would be to facilitate others to do the same - whatever their best life looks like for them.   \n\n\nWhat about you? Are work and passion intertwined? Are you one of the lucky ones settled into the sweet spot of living the life you've always dreamed of, while focusing your attention on the areas that you're most interested in? I want to hear about it, the long winding road that got you there, or the straight path from A to B that led you to living a life of fulfillment. ","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/14ebxti/passion/","comment":"Wow, you and I are the same person. Haha, except you sound much better at disengaging from work to be with your kids, while it's always ruminating for me in the background.\n\nI think my work drives me. Case in point: when I was on maternity leave last year (well, not really, since I run my own business, so I guess it was just time off), I got bored about 3 months in. I started a podcast LOL. I love working. Even if I was financially free, as you said, I would still come back to something that drove me. So my work is my life, and sometimes that's dangerous. I've had 4 businesses. 2 that failed for different reasons, 1 that did well, and 1 that I'm trying to make my full time business right now and transition into it.  Your passion - guiding others to live their best life - is a bit similar to what I do right now in my coaching, though mine is business coaching, and you sound like you want to go more into life coaching.\n\nBut back to your question - what does it mean to live 100% as yourself? I think I am 100% myself. Even when flipping switches. That's part of me. I'm really organized and able to compartmentalize really well, which means that I can go from one thing to another and find joy. Some days I wish my kids and family weren't around so I could work 8 hours uninterrupted for a week! Other days, I feel like I'm itching to get away from my business and spend more time reading or with the kids.\n\nThat's why I built a \"lifestyle\" business though, a business that works around me instead of being controlled by it, but it's still a big part of my life. Without it, I would feel a lot less. And maybe that's something I need to discuss in therapy, but it does drive me every day and helps me feel fulfilled and happy. I have days where I'm more present with kids, less \"on\" for work. Today, Tuesday, I will work about 2-3 hours tops. Tomorrow, about 5, Friday will be about 1 hour. I like that I have this \"organized flexibility\".\n\nI could chat more with you about this, or even link to my site and stories about me that tells you how I got from A to B, but I'm afraid of getting banned for self-promotion (it's happened before even though I've come from a place of service), so happy to chat with you more over messages!"}

They are demanding a $4.5 million payout and are asking Reddit to withdraw a controversial new pricing policy‚Äã1‚Äã.\r  \n\r  \nReddit's CTO, Chris Slowe, had previously posted about a security incident in February, stating that the company‚Äôs systems were hacked through a sophisticated and targeted phishing attack. The hackers reportedly accessed some internal documents, code, and some internal business systems. \r  \n\r  \nThe controversy with Reddit's new pricing policy has led to more than 6,000 Reddit forums going dark in protest. The protest was intended to last for two days, but a week later, more than 3,500 Reddit forums remain dark.  \n\r  \nWhile the hackers' ransom note appears to support the protestors' cause, experts are skeptical of BlackCat's actual motives. Brett Callow, a threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Emsisoft, suspects that the ransomware gang's true intent is to demonstrate the extent of harm they can inflict, in order to increase the likelihood of future victims deciding to pay the ransom‚Äã.\r  \n\r  \nThe BlackCat group, however, stated that they do not expect Reddit to meet their demands and are confident that the data will be leaked‚Äã‚Äã."}

In terms of finances, the business made about ¬£15k profit in its first year, about ¬£10k in its second year and this year is on track to be about the same but this is bearing in mind that I've been very lax with this business and not put much effort into it lately.

Anyways , i owed back taxes on something different so i thought it would be wise to ask for advice other then doing my taxes all by myself that year. I brought up Onlyfans as this individual saw my 10-99 form on the side. after looking at them he said not to bother claiming taxes since i havent made 10,000 or more with Onlyfans and that id be spending hundreds on something that they dont report since i havent made a curtain amount. He did mention to get another credit card and pay for curtain things for tax write offs in the future if i want to make alot more money off Onlyfans. So fast forward to 2023, ive made $8,233 off onlyfans as of right now. When should i pay taxes?  Onlyfans says i dont have to claim anything below $600 yearly if that's all i made..

I was able to collect 100% of a judgment that she got against her ex-husband through various court procedures. In sum, I got a good result for her. About 20% of what I collected was for my legal fees. The fees were very reasonable for the work put in. She demanded that I also get an order that her ex-husband pay my legal fees. I told her we do not have a high chance of success in this since the general rule is, unless there is a contract to the contrary, that each side pays there own legal fees. I ended up, partly because of her pressure, fighting to get her her legal fees and we lost. Now she is angry and wants me to make what I believe is a frivolous appeal. She is highly unstable due to medical issues. She is a lawyer herself, but due to these issues she has not practiced law much.   \n\n\nBasically she is implicityly threatening to sue me if I don't do what she wants. How to avoid a long battle with her. I want to withdraw from the case. The question is, what do I tell her. My thought is just make her know that I am still there to help her brain storm about the case, although I wont be filing anything, and that if she has other issues in the future I am there to help. If she sues me, although it will be frivolous, it will start taking up a lot of my energy over what could be years.

{"title":"Where Reddit went wrong and how to course-correct: a modest proposal","body":"In the process of trying to understand the current state of Reddit and what the future might bring, I found a very interesting post:\n\n[Spez on Reddit‚Äôs monetization](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/xhuaqf/are_we_allowed_to_discuss_what_spez_brought_up_in/?utm_source=share\u0026utm_medium=ios_app\u0026utm_name=ioscss\u0026utm_content=2\u0026utm_term=1)\n\nI think this explains a lot about how unaware Reddit‚Äôs leadership of how the average user interacts with the platform. The post above describes a surreal and clumsy vision for Reddit, with users being ‚Äúempowered‚Äù to barter goods both virtual and physical; where everyone can make money off of everyone else.\n\nThis seems akin to adding a world-class theater to your local Walmart. Maybe you build great acoustics and lightning, hire incredible actors, maybe the acts all receive glowing reviews from famous critics‚Ä¶ It still wouldn‚Äôt work. \n\nThere are countless logistical problems to overcome due to the fact that Walmart was for many years not intended to house a theater, and that customers *are not prepared or interested in interacting with it in that way.*\n\nFor well over a decade, Reddit has been both an aggregate site and a valuable public forum. Reddit offers well-categorized information and the ability to banter with your fellow users about that information. Users who are insightful or funny are ‚Äúrewarded‚Äù with thousands of upvotes and the occasional reward.\n\nThe structure that makes the most here is an advertising platform ‚Äî something Reddit has classically been bad at. In part, this can be explained by a quote from Spez in the post above:\n\n*‚ÄúNow one of the things that there's kind of a cultural thing on reddit that we have to kind of work through, which is kind of the anti-capitalist aspect of reddit. The purity of reddit.‚Äù*\n\nThe simple solution is to offer users incentive to occasionally interact with ads. **Imagine that you can browse Reddit with ads ON or OFF, but browsing with ads on earns you free awards.** Every impression delivered contributes to an account being able to redeem an award, and clicking into an ad or otherwise meeting some call to action contributes in a much, much greater way. Because interacting with other users is such a strong driving force, and awards allow you to interact with posts and comments in an exceptional way, the trade-off would make sense for many of Reddit‚Äôs users. \n\nReddit also shoots itself in the foot with overly-restrictive rules, especially in regards to self-promotion. Mention a project you‚Äôre working on, and even if it‚Äôs heavily upvoted, it will disappear if your account doesn‚Äôt meet the somewhat nebulous requirement that only 1/10th of your content can be self-promotion. Would-be advertisers hoping to make organic posts to gauge interest, or to help understand the culture of a particular subreddit, are driven away in an overzealous effort to make promotion almost exclusively a paid-for thing. In reality, more users would happily advertise on Reddit if they were given the opportunity to explore it a little without great financial risk. \n\nIn short, making ads a benign thing for Reddit‚Äôs audience seems much easier and more user-friendly than reimagining it as some warped, meme-y version of Etsy.\n\nI‚Äôm positing this with the slim hope that someone who is in the position to steer this platform right sees and acts on this simple bit of advice. Thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read this.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/14b6tec/where_reddit_went_wrong_and_how_to_coursecorrect/","comment":"If you know what Modest Proposal refers to, you realize that this suggestion is about eating all the children who are taking up space on Reddit."}

I may offer a voluntary subscription model, allowing readers to contribute an amount of their choice to support the operations of my newsletter. This approach allows me to maintain a direct relationship with my audience and offer them the opportunity to support the content they value. By providing a voluntary subscription option, I give readers the freedom to decide the financial contribution they are comfortable with while still providing them with valuable content. These donations or contributions play a crucial role in sustaining the newsletter, covering expenses such as writing, editing, design, and distribution, and enabling me to continue providing high-quality content to my subscribers.\n\nwhat do you guys think?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/14b5ic6/how_would_someone_monetize_a_newsletter_business/","comment":"Start a corresponding 503 and offer the opportunity to make a charitable donation through the purchase of a product for dual end revenue.

{"title":"Distributors","body":"We are an independent brand and we manufacture a unique products. We have distributors in several countries selling selected products of ours (they choose). Over the past few years, we have noted a slow decline in sales, possibly down to the cost of living issues, and other things, but I have a hunch that some of it may be down to our distributors.\n\nOur distributors usually choose their products and sell them but recently I've been feeling that this is having a negative impact on our business. Sure, you get a large order all at once, but the issue I am seeing is that those customers from abroad now don't come to us for that one product, but more damaging is, that they don't buy add on products with us as they normally would, to make it worthwhile for them buying from abroad, so it has a double impact.  \n\nI'm leaning on the idea of stopping all distributors so that the only place to buy our product is from us.\n\nThoughts please.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/14ar0jy/distributors/","comment":"Answers here are impossible without knowing your market. \n\nThe reason to use a distributor is they have account reach and can administer orders \n\nIn that case, it‚Äôs cheaper for you to administer a few orders to a few accounts vs tons of orders to tons of accounts.  The distributors handle tons of accounts already so adding your product to their mix is not a big cost add.  \n\nIf you‚Äôll be selling directly, you have to worry about administrative cost, and will be down one marketing partner.  \n\nGenerally, if you make this kind of decision, you need to know exactly why your sales are down and analyze costs/benefits of various strategies to boost sales.  \n\nDistributor X is no longer recommending our product.  Why?  What are they doing instead?  Is it better to improve your product/service, look for a new distributor, or go direct? \n\nCustomer X is no longer buying our product.  Why? \n\nHow do you compare to the competition? \n\nSpeak to people in your market, they will have more insight.  Interview your distributors.  Interview your customers.  Then you can make a more informed decision."}

However, you must not have closed your online store, in fact, you would have promoted that innovatively. What matters the most is the age of the brand, and you could have had an edge from that perspective. Newbies always come in businesses, all you have to do is stand out from the competition. \n\nMy advice is to relaunch your clothing brand if possible because you have experience, and this time, you won't be starting from scratch. However, you can go ahead with your popcorn idea, which is solid, later as a growth strategy for your company. Edible items have more stringent laws, and the perishibility factor makes it a bit challenging if you are not much connected with the industry."}
